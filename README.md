## Intro

InglésAventurero teaches English to Spanish speakers by letting the user participate in different scenes.

Each scene is shown as a series of pictures with dialogue. The user can hear the words in English and must reply in English, but the translations and explanations are in Spanish. The app states whether the user's response is acceptable.

The scenes are downloaded from www.appsbyflo.com, which holds the pictures and audio in an AWS bucket.

This repository, IngAve-Android, holds the Android application. The testing summary is in [Testing/testing-summary.pdf](Testing/testing-summary.pdf). The instrumentation tests are in the [src/androidTest](InglesAventurero/app/src/androidTest) folder, the unit tests are in [src/test](InglesAventurero/app/src/test). The instructions for manual tests are in the [Testing/testing-manual-tests.pdf](Testing/test-manual-tests.pdf).
