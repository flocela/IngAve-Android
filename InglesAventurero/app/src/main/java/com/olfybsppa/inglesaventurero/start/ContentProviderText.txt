      Adding a Page from an xml file. The page is named newPage with newAttributions, with
       which I make newAttributionSet.
      It also comes with a newBackgroundName and a newFileName.
    From newPage's background_name get background _id and attr_set_id from background
     table.
    Case 1: Was Not able to find a current background _id.
  Add newBackground and generate new background_id. Add background_id and page_id to
  page_background_pivot_table.
    Case 2: Was able to find a background _id, so background already exists. This scene
     may have an
  updated attribute set and/or attributes for this background. Check and update attributes
   if necessary.
  May also be updating file connected to background, so check on that also.
  Create an attribute set from the newPage's attributes and create a newHashValue.
  Using the attr_set_id  get the current set_hashvalue from the attr_set_table and compare
   to newHashValue.
  Case a: newHashValue is equal to current hashValue. Attributes do not need to be
  updated. Done.
  Case b: newHashValie is not equal to current hashValue.
  Get attributes from set_to_attr_pivot_table and attribution_table.
  For each of the new attributes see if there is a match current attribute that matches.
   (Matching
  means that the image_info_name is the same.) If none of the current attributes matches,
   then add
  the new attribute. If one of the current attributes matches, check to see if it is a
   complete match.
  If a complete match, do nothing, otherwise update it.
  For each of the current attributes that were not matched. If they exist somewhere else
   in the set_to_attr_pivot_table,
  do nothing. If they don't exist again, then delete row in attribution_table.
  Case c: Using the bg_file_id get the filename from the bg_file_table. If it is not the
   same as the
  newFilename, update the filename. Somehow the app must be notified so that the old file
   can be deleted.


      Adding a scene. If the scene already exists, the old scene is deleted completely
       before the
    new scene is added.
